								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								
								<p> Hi! My name is Clarissa Do Ó and I am a fifth (and final!) year Ph.D. candidate at UC San Diego Astrophysics, under the National Science Foundation and San Diego Fellowships. 
									At UCSD, I am working with Prof. Quinn Konopacky on the Gemini Planet Imager's (GPI) adaptive optics upgrade and on studying the orbit fitting and dynamics of exoplanet systems.
								I earned my B.S. in Physics at UC Santa Barbara with a minor in Astronomy and Planetary Science. At UCSB, I worked with Prof. Ben Mazin on the MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC) data reduction pipeline. </p>
								<p> My research interest is in understanding the formation of widely separated gas giant planets ("exo-Jupiters").  </p> 
								In order to understand giant planet formation processes, I employ a variety of methods, such as using observational data from telescopes to characterize their orbits and atmospheres, 
								simulating the dynamics of forming planets using our current theoretical models, and 
								upgrading instruments that will allow for the detection of more exoplanets (to see my specific projects, please go to my Research tab). </p>
								I grew up in São Paulo, Brazil, which is where I fell in love with astronomy after visiting the Ibirapuera Planetarium as a kid. Outside of the lab, I am passionate about coffee (most recently, I've also been interested in matcha), ice skating, and Star Wars. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								I am interested in the intersection of exoplanet instrumentation, observations and theory - all to understand planet formation (mostly from a dynamical perspective)! 
								Detecting widely separated giant planets involves developing cutting-edge instruments that allow us to image them.
								Here, I wrote a small summary of what are my interests and what I am currently working on for research. You can find my co-authored publications below.

								<h3>Exoplanet Orbits & Dynamics</h3>

								<h4> Statistical Study of Planet Populations from Orbit Fitting </h4>

							<p> Using astrometry and radial velocitiy measurements of directly imaged exoplanets, it is possible to fit for these planets' orbits in order to constrain their orbital parameters. 
							However, many of these planets have long periods (10s-1000s of years long!), which means that we have a low phase coverage of their orbital arcs.
							This low coverage can lead to biases in their parameters from the orbit fits. 
							I used observable-based priors - a new approach to orbit fitting which aims to reduce the parameter bias in low phase coverage orbits - to analyze the eccentricity of exoplanets at a population level. 
							Understanding the eccentricity distributions of exoplanets can shed light on how they were formed. <b> This work has been published in The Astronomical Journal.</b> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acdc9a">IOP</a>  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....166...48D/abstract">ADS</a> </p>

									<h4> High Resolution Spectroscopy to obtain Planet Radial Velocities </h4>

							<p> Radial velocities from high resolution spectroscopy are useful for eliminating degeneracies in orbit fitting, because they provide a third dimension of information to orbit fitting. In particular,
							they can remove the degeneracy between the longitude of ascending node (Ω) and the argument of periapsis (ω), as well as helping with the eccentricity-inclination degeneracy of orbits. The companion to the 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system presented an unconstrained orbit fit.
							I used high resolution spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) and a new astrometric measurement from Keck/NIRC2 to re-calculate the system's mass and orbit, finding a better constrained orbit for the companion. 
							<b> This work has been published in The Astronomical Journal.</b> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad3df3">IOP</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240407742D/abstract">ADS</a> </p>

									<h4> Orbital and Hydrodynamic Simulations of Protoplanetary disks </h4>

							<p> I have begun tests to analyze how the eccentricities of protoplanets change with time using current theoretical models for planet formation. 
								Forming planets are still embedded in 
							their protoplanetary disk. The goal is to use orbital dynamics and hydrodynamic simulations to analyze how the formation process affects young planets' orbital architectures!

						    <h4> Stability of Exoplanet Systems </h4>

						    <p>Using astrometry for orbit fits and N-Body simulations, I am interested in constraining the stability of exoplanet systems. One system I am currently studying is HR 8799, the only directly imaged system with 4 gas giants. The HR 8799 system planets are believed to be coplanar and in 1:2:4:8 mean-motion resonance (MMR). 
							    Understanding the dynamics of exoplanet systems becomes important for understanding their formation as well as the long-term stability as new candidate planets are imaged in multiple-planet systems. <b> This work has been published in The Astronomical Journal.</b> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aca1af">IOP</a>  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165...29T/abstract">ADS</a> </p>

						  <h3>Instrumentation</h3>


						    <h4> GPI 2.0  </h4>
						    <p>Currently, many of our observations for exoplanet detection are ground based (our Telescopes are on Earth and not in space).
							    This means that the Earth's atmosphere can interfere on our images due to its turbulence.
							    The atmosphere severely limits the power of large telescopes, because it distorts the incoming light (called a wavefront), generating something called wavefront error.
							    This limitation led astronomers to develop a technology called adaptive optics (AO), which uses deformable mirrors to correct the turbulences introduced by the Earth's atmosphere (or correct for the wavefront error). 
							    The adaptive optics technology is constantly being improved, and is essential for ground based instruments that are searching for exoplanets. </p>
							<p> I am working on the upgrade of the Gemini Planet Imager's (GPI) wavefront sensor. The upgrade involves building and testing a pyramid wavefront sensor. 
								I have built the test source unit (TSU) for the wavefront sensor, which will allow us to test for the system's alignment. 
								I have also tested the wavefront sensor's detector, an EMCCD camera - checking for its noise contributors and overall functionality. GPI 2.0 will be assembled and installed at Gemini North. 
								These upgrades will allow us to find new exoplanets and to obtain high quality data on already known planets. 
								<b>I have an AO4ELT Proceeding on the test results for GPI 2.0's wavefront sensor EMCCD.</b> <a href="https://hal.science/AO4ELT7/hal-04419969">HAL</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06276">arXiv</a>  
							        <b>I also have an SPIE Proceeding on the test results to improve the wavefront sensor's camera image quality.</b> <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13097/3019439/GPI-20--exploring-the-impact-of-different-readout-modes/10.1117/12.3019439.short">SPIE</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06276">arXiv</a>  </p>
